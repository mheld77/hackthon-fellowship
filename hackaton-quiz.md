Housing - Every Pittsburgher should have access to safe and dignified housing. We must invest in building new and rehabbing existing housing to expand the city’s housing stock and create a city affordable to all. 


Working Families - Families across our districts are worried about keeping their heads above water and making sure that their children have a bright future ahead of them. I believe without addressing rising childcare costs, healthcare reform and addressing student debt, we are failing families in our community.


Jobs & the Economy - Our local economy is fueled by small businesses, entrepreneurs and workers. Pennsylvania needs to protect its workers by raising the minimum wage and making it easier to start and grow businesses in our district.

* Category: Community Assets

- I want them (community) to do so much better with reducing crime in our city.

* Category: Jobs & the Economy 

- I want our schools to be so much better with performance, and for kids to graduate knowing how to get a job, and I want the Pittsburgh area to grow again with jobs, and I don’t know if they are going to have that kind of initiative.
